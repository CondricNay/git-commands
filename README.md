#### Note on Paths

In this file, directory paths are written with a forward slash as on MacOS, Linux, and the Windows-Bash shell: `/dir1/dir2/somefile`.    


## Basics

1. When using Git locally, what are these?  Define each one in a sentence
   ```
   * Staging area - It is a temporary area where changes are prepared for commit in Git repository.
   * Working copy - It is the local directory where we make changes to files before staging/committing.
   * master - It is a default branch name.
   * HEAD - It is reference point to the most recent commit in a branch.
   ```

2. When you install git on a new machine (or in a new user account) you should perform these 2 git commands to tell git your name and email.  These values are used in commits that you make:
   ```
   git config --global user.name "name"
   git config --global user.email "email"
   ```

3. There are 2 ways to create a local Git repository.  Briefly describe each one:
   - Initialize a new repository. 
   - Clone an existing repository.


## Adding and Changing Things

Suppose your working copy of a repository contains these files and directories:
```
README.md
out/
    a.exe
src/a.py
    b.py
    c.py
test/
    test_a.py
    ...
```     

1. Add README.md and *everything* in the `src` directory to the git staging area.
   ```
   git add README.md src/
   ```

2. Add `test/test_a.py` to the staging area (but not any other files).
   ```
   git add test/test_a.py
   ```

3. List the names of files in the staging area.
   ```
   git diff --name-only --cached
   ```

4. Remove `README.md` from the staging area. This is **very useful** if you accidentally add something you don't want to commit.
   ```
   git reset HEAD README.md
   ```

5. Commit everything in the staging area to the repository.
   ```
   git commit -m "message"
   ```

6. In any project, there are some files and directories that you **should not** commit to git.    
   For a Python project, name *at least* files or directories that you should not commit to git:
   ```
   - .pyc/.pyo
   - venv/, virtualenv/
   - __pycache__/
   ```


7. Command to move all the .py files from the `src` dir to the top-level directory of this repository. This command moves them in your working copy *and* in the git repo (when you commit the change):
   ```
   git mv src/*.py .
   ```


8. In this repository, create your own `.gitignore` file that you can reuse in other Python projects.  Add everything that you think is relevant.    
   *Hint:* A good place to start is to create a new repo on Github and during the creation dialog, ask Github to make a .gitignore for Python projects. Then edit it.  Don't forget to include pytest output and MacOS junk.



## Undo Changes and Recover Files

> For questions where you are showing a command, use triple-backquote marks (as above) so the text is formatted as code.

1.  Display the differences between your *working copy* of `a.py` and the `a.py` in the *local repository* (HEAD revision):
   ```
   git diff HEAD a.py
   ```

2. Display the differences between your *working copy* of `a.py` and the version in the *staging area*. (But, if a.py is not in the staging area this will compare working copy to HEAD revision):
   ```
   git diff --staged a.py
   ```

3. **View changes to be committed:** Display the differences between files in the staging area and the versions in the repository. (You can also specify a file name to compare just one file.)
   ```
   git diff --cached
   ```


4. **Undo "git add":** If `main.py` has been added to the staging area (`git add main.py`), remove it from the staging area:
   ```
   git restore --staged main.py
   ```

5. **Recover a file:** Command to replace your working copy of `a.py` with the most recent (HEAD) version in the repository.  This also works if you have deleted your working copy of this file.
   ```
   git restore a.py
   ```

6. **Undo a commit:** Suppose you want to discard some commit(s) and move both HEAD and "master" to an earlier revision (an earlier commit)  Suppose the git commit graph looks like this (`aaaa`, etc, are the commit ids)
   ```
   aaaa ---> bbbb ---> cccc ---> dddd [HEAD -> master]

   git reset --hard bbbb
   ``` 
   The command to reset HEAD and master to the commit id `bbbb`:


7. **Checkout old code:** Using the above example, the command to replace your working copy with the files from commit with id `aaaa`:
   ```
   git checkout aaaa -- .
   ```
    Note:
    - Git won't let you do this if you have uncommitted changes to any "tracked" files.
    - Untracked files are ignored, so after doing this command they will still be in your working copy.
 

## Viewing Commits

1. Show the history of commits, using one line per commit:
   ```
   git log --oneline
   ```
   Some versions of git have an *alias* "log1" for this (`git log1`).

2. Show the history (as above) including *all* branches in the repository and include a graph connecting the commits:
   ```
   git log --graph --oneline --all
   ```


3. List all the files in the current branch of the repository:
   ```
   git ls-tree --name-only HEAD
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   .gitignore
   README.md
   a.py
   b.py
   test/test_a.py
   test/test_b.py
   ```


## Branch and Merge

1. Create new branch
   > git checkout -b new-branch-name

2. Delete existing branch
   > git branch -d branch-name

3. Check all branch
   > git branch 

4. Switch branch
   > git checkout branch-name

5. Merging branches
   > git merge branch-name


## Favorites

> To recover a file, use: git restore a.py
